# Eventabase

## Current Status
The site is still very much a work in progress with regard to achieving its full originally intended functionality, and there is still some functionality needed in order to reach an MVP. As it stands a user can create/edit an account, a profile, as well post new event adverts. They can also view the events they are currently advertising to host; view the confirmed events they are hosting that are upcoming. The user can also delete adverts, and cancel their upcoming events.

The minimal functionality required to search for advertised events and activities, in order to register to attend is currently being implemented. As well as this the communication between users is also currently being developed. Once both of these aspects have been implemented, an MVP will be achieved. Much of the more advanced/higher performance functionality and features as originally intended (see [UX Design process](https://github.com/MatthewBayfield/eventabase#ux-design-process)) can then be added sequentially; for example search filters, event shortlists, notifications, automated site maintenance, and event calendars.

## UX Design Process

### Strategy

Often people have the problem of wanting to participate in an activity
or attend an event, but lack other people needed or desired to do an activity,
or attend an event with. Additionally many people are interested in activities
on offer in their local area and beyond, that give them the chance to do
something fun or try something new, both whilst socialising and making new friends;
whether it be looking for a hitting partner in tennis, organising a camping
trip, or going paintballing and so on.

The purpose of the eventabase site is to allow registered users to advertise
group-based events or activities, that other users can register their interest
for participation in. The user organising the event/activity can then select who
to invite, and can communicate further information with those invited to attend.

### Scope

#### Requirements
Considering the strategic goals and user needs of the site as expressed in the previous section, the following table dictates a core set of requirements --- each assigned with an importance rating --- for the eventabase site. Time constraints along with the relative importance and feasibility of requirements will determine which requirements are prioritised, and thus fulfilled in the minimal viable product.

### Structure

#### Information design
Access to content, and the available functionality on the site will be determined based on the type of user. Users can be split into signed-in users --- which further can be split into registered user accounts and site administrator accounts --- and users not signed-in with a user account. User accounts will require passwords which will be stored in hashed form using django's default hashing algorithm; the non-admin accounts will also require email verification.

The site will potentially consist of the following pages:

Accessible to all users:
- a generic landing/home page - will act as the first point of contact, and explain the purpose of the site as well as how to use the site. It will need to be attractive
and fairly minimal. Must contain clearly visible sign-up and sign-in options for the user to interact with.
- a sign-up/registration page - must enable validated form input for the user's name, username, email, and password. Upon registering and verifying their account email, the
user should be taken to their home page.
- a T & C page containing the terms and conditions of the site.

Accessible to registered users only:
- a registered user home page - Once registered users have signed in, they should be taken to their home page. This page will contain navigation and button elements that allow the user to view other relevant pages or modals/panels, and thus perform all of the desired functionality on the site. The page should be divided into a profile section; a search/host events and activities section. The latter section will have distinct subsections, including a section for reviewing/rating other users and activities/events.
- search and retrieve events/activities page - This page will display a list of events/activities retrieved from the database, filtered using available filters. Each item in the list will be able to be expanded to view more information about the item.
- registered user message/notifications dashboard page - will feature messages from admins and other users, as well as notifications about new events/activities or when someone registers their interest in an activity/event hosted by the user. Should allow communication between admins and users.


Accessible to site admins only:
- an administrator home page - This page will host all of the functionality necessary to perform administrative duties, such as editing the T & C, viewing user accounts and
events/activities etc.
- admin message dashboard - will feature messages/reports from users. Should allow communication between admins and users.

Accessible to site admins and registered users:
- an account settings page - where a user can change their account email, password, and username; as well as delete their account.

#### Interaction design

A navigation bar common to all registered-user-accessible pages and admin-accessible pages other than the T & C page, will feature a home button link, a sign-out link, a message/notifications indicator/link and a 'more' hamburger icon menu; the hamburger menu featuring an account settings and T & C link. The all-user-accessible landing page will feature a nav bar with only a sign-in/sign-up link, and a T & C link within a hamburger icon menu. The T & C page nav bar will feature a sign-out/sign-in/sign-up link and a home button link.

Modals opened on one of the pages or expandable side panels, will be used frequently to allow functionality such as posting new events/activities, viewing more information about an event/activity etc. These modals or side panels will be opened when labelled buttons, links, or icons are clicked by the user. They will take up most of the page, and will be closable both automatically and manually by the user. 

Most pages will feature content that can be expanded and collapsed, thus decluttering the page while keeping all functionality and content available when needed.

For the pages/modals/panels requiring extended user input --- such as the user profile, or when writing a review --- validated form fields will be used.

Depending on the user sign-in status, the type of user, as well as other state factors, the available buttons and other interactive elements displayed will vary, and change
dynamically. For example if a user has registered their interest in an event/activity using the 'register interest button', the button will change to allow the user the functionality of unregistering interest.

#### Planned site structure/connectivity diagrams

The first diagram below shows the possible page, modal, and panel connectivity not using the navigation bar; it assumes all requirements/user stories are fulfilled. The 2nd diagram shows the connectivity between pages using only the navigation bars.

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes
Below are links to the mobile wireframes of each page, as well as for the modals; there are no separate desktop wireframes, as the intention is to keep the appearance of
the site as a whole the same across all devices, using only a responsive design as opposed to an adaptive design; this will be achieved in part by allowing vertical scrolling on all pages, modals, and panels where needed.

### Surface

'Hover for more info' icons will be used to guide the user in understanding how to use parts of the site, as well as when providing user input or interpreting displayed information. Regular feedback and helper prompts will also be provided to the user where necessary in order to maximise user experience and minimise user effort. 

Icons and other visual aids will also be used where possible to further make using the site simple and more enjoyable; for example a new message/notification counter will
be visible just above the message dashboard icon link in the nav bar. An attempt will be made to dynamically focus the user's attention where it needs to be, throughout performing a specific task; for example changes to background or font colours as well as the use of highlighting/dimming will be used where suitable.

Compulsory form/input fields will be indicated, and missing or invalid inputs will be highlighted to users, with a clarifying explanation message.

Images will be used on the landing page, as well on advertised events/activities where the user uploads an image. An uploaded profile image may also be available
to the user. Likewise some animation/transitions will feature on the landing page, through a slide show of background header images, and a cycling of messages in a bar
below the header, that motivate use of the site, and indicate its purpose to the user.

Finally, in regard to the potential typography and colour schemes employed, the aim will be to maximise the readability and also attractiveness of the site content, by creating 
a clear pattern of use that helps to distinguish content and highlight the most important content. The final choices will be decided through experimentation and manual user feedback, as well as by which fonts and color scheme combinations sufficiently satisfy accessibility requirements.
